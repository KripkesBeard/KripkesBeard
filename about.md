## About

I am a logician at heart. I study symbolic logic and its application to the fields of philosophy, 
mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and physics. I am especially interested in the study 
of languages, both artificial and natural, and their formal semantics.

In the realm of computer science, the primary programming languages I use are Haskell, Scheme, 
Prolog, and C. I work maily with interpreters, compilers, embedded domain specific languages, 
metalinguistic abstractions, and the foundations of programming language theory.

Currently I am an undergraduate persuing a double major in Philosophy and Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.
