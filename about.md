## About

I am a logician at heart. I study symbolic logic and its application to the fields of philosophy, 
mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and physics. I am especially interested in the study 
of languages, both artificial and natural, and their formal semantics.

In the realm of computer science, the primary programming languages I use are Haskell, Scheme, 
Prolog, and C. I work maily with interpreters, compilers, embedded domain specific languages, 
metalinguistic abstractions, and the foundations of programming language theory.

Currently I am an undergraduate persuing a double major in Philosophy and Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.

As for the name, [Saul Kripke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke) is a legendary philosopher and logician. His work, across all these fields, is hard to miss and is some of the main 
inspiration behind my interest in these subjects. So, why his beard? There is a very old philosophical problem which was given the nick name 
["Plato's Beard"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_beard) by Quine. I believe one of the problems Kripke raised in the philosophy of language (for those who know, the 
argument from "A Puzzle About Belief" that propositional attitudes are just as much an issue for the descriptivist's theory) is equally as vexing as Plato's.
