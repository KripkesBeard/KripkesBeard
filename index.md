Hello! My name is Peter, welcome to my website.

On this page you can find my programming work, focusing mainly on functional programming, interpreters, and compilers. 
You can click the summary below each project title to find out more about each one. You can also find out more about 
me [here](https://kripkesbeard.github.io/about), and contact me at kripkesbeard@gmail.com

## Fragments

Fragments is a Haskell library for natural language semantics. You can find out
more about it [here](https://kripkesbeard.github.io/fragmentssummary).

## Programming for Philosophers

Programming for Philosophers is the beginnings of a textbook written to 
introduce philosophy students to programming and show them how they can use 
functional and logic programming languages as tools to help them study their field.
You can find out more about it [here](https://github.com/KripkesBeard/programming-for-philosophers).

## Advent of Code

Every December I participate in Advent of Code for the first week or so. I 
maintain a github repo of my solutions in Haskell 
[here](https://github.com/KripkesBeard/AoC).

## School Projects

I completed two term projects for an Intro To Object-Oriented Programming class in 
Java. One was a desert rat running simulator, found 
[here](https://github.com/KripkesBeard/DesertRatRunner), 
and the other was a program which read CSV data for students and universities and 
then serialized the data into binaries as well as created a formatted text report 
summarizing it all, which can be found 
[here](https://github.com/KripkesBeard/StudentsAndUniversities).
