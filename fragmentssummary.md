# Fragments
## Formal Semantics via Functional Programming

Fragments is a Haskell library which implements formal semantics for natural 
language as a series of embedded domain specific languages. The library will have 
a progression of logical systems starting from the propositional calculus and 
going to an intensional higher-order type theory. Using these systems, it will 
implement various phenomena from natural language semantics such as generalized 
quantifiers, anaphora, and presupposition. It will also use techniques from 
functional programming such as continuations, recursion schemes, optics, and 
monads to model all of thse phenomena as well. It also expands on the hierarchy of 
logics to study hyperintensional logic and problems related to the philosophy of 
language such as propositional attitude reports and logical necessity.

You can find the github repo for the library

## Current Status 

### Phase 1: Logic Systems

The project is currently in phase 1. Phase 1 involves implementing, documenting, 
and setting up tests for the core logical systems of the library.
